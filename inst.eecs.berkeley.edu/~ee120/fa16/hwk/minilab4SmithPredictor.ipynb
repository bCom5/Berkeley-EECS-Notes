    "<b>Some control systems have very long delays.</b> We've been studying systems with feedback, and examining the stability of such systems by understanding phase margin. In many control systems that we might build in the lab or in the field, we may have a system that is a long way away from the controller, introducing a significant delay in the feedback. We sometimes call this \"dead time\", and it can cause significant problems for a control system. In this lab, we'll work through an example of control with dead time, and try to accommodate it using a control architecture known as the \"Smith Predictor\". "
